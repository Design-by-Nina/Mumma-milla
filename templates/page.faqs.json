To keep your nipple health in-check it's very important to wash your bras daily to keep them hygienic and clean. Many of our mums enjoy our<a href=\"https:\/\/mumma-milla.com\/products\/black-day-bralette\" target=\"_blank\"> 4-PACK<\/a> bundles.<\/p><p>We also ask for you to make sure to NOT keep wearing your bra if it is completely saturated. Woman's breastmilk leakage\/let-downs differ from person to person, so please use your discretion and change the bra throughout the course of the day\/night if you have over-supply, heavy let-downs. It's imperative to not wear a saturated bra against your skin. You can always pop in some silicone milk catchers or re-usable bamboo nursing pads whilst nursing to help with heavy flow.<\/p>"}},"text_zRhMhD":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"I have heavy-let downs and leak through all my clothes and sheets, what do I do?","answer":"<p>We have designed our leakproof bras to capture as much milk as possible, however, our bras cannot keep up with extreme milk loss unfortunately.<br\/><br\/>If this is the case for you, we recommend using our bralettes for short periods of time. Alternatively you can keep a supply of bralettes so you can change them throughout the course of the day with our bundles which is a popular choice for many mums.<br\/><br\/>For our night time bras we suggest maybe adding in the re-usable bamboo nursing pads to begin with and you can take these out during the night. It saves you having to put in new pads during the crazy nursing hours at night time.<\/p>"}},"text_wkpCfT":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"","answer":""}},"text_gQPNDT":{"type":"text","settings":{"question":"What is the difference between the day bra and the night bra?","answer":"<p> - Our day bra features a very discreet soft cup with it's built in absorbent layers. The cups not only provide shape and support, but also give you coverage throughout the day so nipples don't show through clothing. <\/p><p>- Our night time bra has no cups but also has built in leakproof layers.

Delicate care is advised ie. hand washing with a natural detergent, not wringing out, drying flat and keeping out of direct sunlight.<br\/><br\/>Very rarely some pilling and bobbles in areas of high friction can occur if you wear items of clothing \/ fabrics that are rough against the bralettes ie. rough linen etc.<\/p><p>This can also occur if the bralettes are placed in a washing bag with other bras with hooks and clasps. Best to hand wash.<\/p><p>We suggest that this can easily be removed by using a pilling comb and lightly combing pilling away.<br\/><br\/>For those who are drying their bras during winter periods, with limited sunlight, it's important to make sure all layers of the garment dry quickly in a good ventilated and heated space to speed up drying time.<\/p><p>Do not iron. Do not dry clean. Do not tumble dry.
